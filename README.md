# Data Science Comeback 

I've been really out of the loop for the past 4 years due to having to drop out of college to take care of my
ill grandpa. Now it's been a year since I've been mourning his lost and feel ready to get back on track! 
can't be losing any more time :)!
Documenting my daily progress!
